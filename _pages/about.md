<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Ph.D degree in Control Science and Engineering from [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/), China, in 2021, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Sun](http://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1281/4511.htm). During my Ph.D, I was also with the [National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology](http://robot.hnu.edu.cn/). From 2019 to 2021, I studied in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore as a visiting scholar, under the supervision of Prof. [Roger Zimmermann](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/rogerz/).

My research interests include:
-  Indoor Localization with Wireless Sensing and Analytics
-  Multi-robot Multi-task Allocation in Unknown Environment
-  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
-  3D Sensor and Time of Flight (ToF)
-  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Optimization

- The Access Point(AP) discrimination criterion (APDC) is introduced to quantify the discernibility of the APs detected in the workspace
- Localization residual is fed and learnt by the model, and large localization errors are mitigated by the location modification method
